The building has served many purposes over the years. It started as offices for the Rio Grande railroad system, and as a hotel on the second floor. In 1888, the building became a hardware store and even though it changed owners three times, the building remained a hardware store until it became a ski and sports store in 1971. The building even served as a restaurant and bar for a few years. In 1989, the building became the Gunnison Arts Center and, shortly after, was restored into the historical landmark that is present today.</p>', '<ul> <li>The Gunnison Arts Center (GAC) was constructed in 1882 and is listed on the Colorado State Historic Register as one of the most important and visible historic structures on the south end of the Gunnison Valley. This building is on the State Register of historic landmarks.</li> <li>Originally, the Gunnison Arts Center’s building was financed by Mary Mechling, for whom the original building was named after. Mechling purchased the lot in 1880 and two years later had the building constructed by Fredrick Zugelder, a highly respected local master stonemason and stonecutter, and his partner Thomas D. Russell. Upon its completion, the first floor became the rail freight offices for the Denver & Rio Grande Railway. At the same time, the second floor served as private rooms for the European Hotel. According to local lore, many people believed the hotel also operated as a brothel, but these stories are not confirmed.</li> <li>In 1888, Mechling sold the building to F.D. Steel, who owned the Gunnison Hardware Company, and used the building as their new storefront.</li> <li>The Steel family ran their business out of the building until 1931, when W.J. Diog bought the property and continued to use the building as a hardware store. </li> <li>Sometime between 1940 and 1951, Alex Campbell took charge of the building’s title, and continued to operate a hardware store out of the building.</li> <li>In 1960 the hardware store changed hands once again, this time to Clayton Hansen. Hansen continued the hardware store, adding motor repair to the services offered, and manufactured his own Hansen Weather ports as well.</li> <li>In 1971, Leo and Judy Klinker purchased the building and changed it from the hardware store to their Klinkerhaus Ski and Sports store. Klinkerhaus Ski and Sports closed its doors in Gunnison, and the Klinkers rented the building to Three Thieves restaurant for a couple of years. When the Three Thieves restaurant folded around 1979, the Klinker family started their own restaurant and bar called Klink’s Place. Klink’s Place operated in the building from 1980-1988, until the building fell into bank receivership.</li> <li>In 1989 the Gunnison Council for the Arts entered into a lease/purchase option agreement with the First National Bank of Gunnison. The Council immediately began using the building as its arts center without making any physical changes. After a fundraising campaign in 1992, the council was able to purchase the building outright, and the Gunnison Arts Center was established. In the mid to late 90s the building got funding to restore the building to its original façade as seen today.</li> <li>The history of the Art Center Building reflects economic and cultural trends in Gunnison’s history. First, created and used by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, the building reflects the progressive beginnings of the town as it emerged from a dusty settlement to an economic transportation hub for the mineral rich area. Secondly, used as a hardware store for decades, the building’s usage demonstrates the need for hardware goods to enable Gunnison residents to build and fix their homes, ranches, and businesses, transforming Gunnison from a transport hub to a town. As a ski shop and restaurant, the building’s usage reflects the growing tourism boom of the mid to late twentieth century that grew with the newly developed Crested Butte Mountain Ski Resort and Blue Mesa Reservoir. Under ownership by the Gunnison Art Center, the building reflects Gunnison’s growing arts scene, which is important to the cultural development of the Gunnison Valley.</li> </ul>'),

Walker Burkett bought the building and the property in 1901, and when Effie Jane Lashbrook arrived in Gunnison with her sick husband and children in 1901, she took over the empty building. She turned the lower floor into a restaurant and made living quarters for her family upstairs and named the restaurant the Royal Cafe. Burnett leased the building to Sam and Anna Francis (Frankie) Johnson for their restaurant in 1904 and at that time, it became the Johnson Restaurant. Johnson\'s bought the building on October 20, 1920. Sam and Frankie (after Sam\'s death in 1923) continued the restaurant until Frankie died in 1942. Their daughter Sarah Trine and her husband Harry bought her brother\'s share. Sarah continued to operate the restaurant (summers only in later years) until 1985. In 1996, the Tredway family bought the Johnson Building from Sarah Trine. They have restored and renovated both floors of the building. The lower floor is now a Gallery where many of the original antiques are on display. The upper floors are offices.</p>'),

The building stared as a masonry company named shilling and company the first floor being the retail store and then the other floors being living space and storage spaces. The building was sold in 1889 to Herman Webster an influential man in town who was involved in Gunnison politics being mayor for a year. This building has had many different uses such as a hotel, restaurant, barbershop, and now even a pet shop. </p>', '<ul>\r\n  <li>The Gunnison Hotel building was originally built to be a dry Goods store on Main Street. It was constructed by Milo D. Mattison, in 1882.</li>\r\n  <li>The building was first used in 1882 as a dry goods store by Shilling & Company. It was advertised in the Gunnison Daily Review-Press during 1883, 1884 and early 1885. The store sold dry goods, carpets, millinery, ladies\' and children’s\' shoes, Butterwick patterns, gloves and hosiery, and tea and spices.</li>\r\n  <li>In May 1889 Mattison sold the building to Herman Merrett Webster and E. P. Shov, who owned it jointly until August 1894, when Shov sold-out to Webster. Herman Webster came to Gunnison in 1882 to start a dry goods business. Webster became one of the town builders in Gunnison and was a successful merchant. In 1885 a lady from Illinois, May E. Smith came to Gunnison to marry Webster.</li>\r\n  <li>Webster had made enough profits during the 1880\'s in Gunnison to buy the building for his business. He previously had a store on Main Street which rivalled Shilling & Company.</li>\r\n  <li>Webster did well at his new location in the Mattison building (Gunnison Hotel) which came to be known as the Webster house.</li>\r\n  <li>The dry goods store occupied the first floor The store was well kept and well supplied, with anything from linens to marbles. The Webster family lived on the second floor of the building. Their apartment was nicely furnished and well kept. The front of it, looking out onto Main Street, was a large living room. The third floor was used for Oddfellow\'s and Mason\'s meetings, recitals, and for a convention hall.</li>\r\n  <li>Herman Webster operated his business until his death in 1920. During the years before his death, he served one year as mayor several years as a councilmen and director of the first National Bank in Gunnison.</li>\r\n  <li>After his death Herman\'s wife, May E. sold the building to B. Russell and E. Anna Wightman in April 1921. Wightman and one Mrs. Carmen Johnson, converted it into a hotel in the early 1920\'s. It was called the Gunnison Hotel and had eight rooms on each of the second and third stories. Carmen Johnson had a tearoom on the first floor, and an apartment in the rear.</li>\r\n  <li>During Wightman\'s ownership of the building, it was leased by one Mrs. Esther Johnson. She was not related to Carmen. She managed the hotel from 1929 and had a Swedish home cooking restaurant on the main floor. It was known as the \"Commercial Hotel\" because it was geared to the travelling salesman.</li>\r\n  <li>The hotel never had a liquor license, probably because of May Webster’s strict ways. She wanted nothing to do with alcohol-drinking.</li>\r\n  <li>In July 1932 Wightman’s sold out to three women. They were Laura Allen, Mary Duncan, and Lory M. Lowery. Laura Allen converted part of the main floor into a barbershop. She did not change the hotel rooms on the second and third floors.</li>\r\n  <li>In August 1939 Badger A. and Ruby N. Willson bought the Gunnison Hotel, which was still referred to as the \"commercial Hotel\". The main floor no longer held a restaurant.

Edsall leased It, also from Walter and Hauck. </li>\r\n<li>In April 1972 the two sisters sold the building to Robert C. Overton and Richard Dudley. Records and information on the ownership and management of the hotel building are quite unclear after this time.

Runge leased the building from April 1972 and started the Crystal Ice Cream Parlor on the main floor. The second and third floors remained unchanged as apartments. The Crystal Ice Cream parlor was changed to be Tin Pot Annie\'s in the early 1970\'. Patrick and Pattie Zielke ran It as a restaurant-ice cream parlor, from November 1975 for about two years.</li>\r\n<li>The J.M.P. Construction Co. bought the building in March 1978, and later renamed their company the Gunnison Hotel Co. </li>\r\n<li>The name of the restaurant was changed to \"Brothers\" in November 1978 and lasted until August 1979.
